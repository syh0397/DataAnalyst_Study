# Hacker Rank (~Occupations)

**The PADS**

ðŸ“ŒÂ Generate the following two result sets:

1. Query anÂ *alphabetically ordered*Â list of all names inÂ **OCCUPATIONS**, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example:Â `AnActorName(A)`,Â `ADoctorName(D)`,Â `AProfessorName(P)`, andÂ `ASingerName(S)`.
2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation inÂ **OCCUPATIONS**. Sort the occurrences inÂ *ascending order*, and output them in the following format:
    
    > There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
    > 
    
    whereÂ `[occupation_count]`Â is the number of occurrences of an occupation inÂ **OCCUPATIONS**Â andÂ `[occupation]`Â is theÂ *lowercase*Â occupation name. If more than oneÂ *Occupation*Â has the sameÂ `[occupation_count]`, they should be ordered alphabetically.
    

**Note:**Â There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(NAME,'(',LEFT(OCCUPATION, 1),')') 
FROM OCCUPATIONS 
ORDER BY NAME;

SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(*), ' ', LOWER(OCCUPATION), 's.') 
FROM OCCUPATIONS 
GROUP BY OCCUPATION 
ORDER BY COUNT(*), OCCUPATION;
```

ðŸ“ŒÂ PivotÂ theÂ *Occupation*Â column inÂ **OCCUPATIONS**Â so that eachÂ *Name*Â is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its correspondingÂ *Occupation*. The output column headers should beÂ *Doctor*,Â *Professor*,Â *Singer*, andÂ *Actor*, respectively.

**Note:**Â PrintÂ **NULL**Â when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

```sql
SELECT Max(CASE
             WHEN occupation = 'Doctor' THEN NAME
           END) 'Doctor',
       Max(CASE
             WHEN occupation = 'Professor' THEN NAME
           END) 'Professor',
       Max(CASE
             WHEN occupation = 'Singer' THEN NAME
           END) 'Singer',
       Max(CASE
             WHEN occupation = 'Actor' THEN NAME
           END) 'Actor'
FROM   (SELECT *,
               Row_number()
                 OVER (
                   partition BY occupation
                   ORDER BY NAME) rn
        FROM   occupations) t
GROUP  BY rn
